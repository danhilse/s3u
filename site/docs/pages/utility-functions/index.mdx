## Troubleshooting

Here are solutions to common issues you might encounter when using S3U.

### Authentication Issues

#### "Access Denied" Error

**Symptom**:
```
Error uploading file.jpg: AccessDenied - Access Denied (Service: Amazon S3)
```

**Possible Causes**:
1. Invalid or expired AWS credentials
2. Insufficient IAM permissions
3. Bucket policy restrictions

**Solutions**:
1. Verify your AWS credentials:
   ```bash
   aws sts get-caller-identity
   ```
   
2. Check your IAM permissions. You need at least these permissions:
   ```json
   {
     "Effect": "Allow",
     "Action": [
       "s3:PutObject",
       "s3:GetObject",
       "s3:ListBucket"
     ],
     "Resource": [
       "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
       "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
     ]
   }
   ```

3. Try a different AWS profile:
   ```bash
   s3u -config aws_profile other-profile
   ```

### Upload Problems

#### Slow Uploads

**Symptom**: Uploads take significantly longer than expected.

**Possible Causes**:
1. Network limitations
2. Excessive concurrency causing throttling
3. Very large files

**Solutions**:
1. Adjust concurrency based on your network:
   ```bash
   s3u -c 5  # Lower value for stability
   ```
   
2. For large files, try optimizing before upload:
   ```bash
   s3u
   # Select 'yes' for optimization
   ```
   
3. Check your network connection quality and bandwidth

#### Timeouts During Upload

**Symptom**:
```
Error uploading large_video.mp4: Connection timed out
```

**Possible Causes**:
1. Network instability
2. File size too large for single operation
3. AWS throttling

**Solutions**:
1. Reduce concurrency:
   ```bash
   s3u -c 3
   ```
   
2. For large files, consider splitting them into smaller parts
3. Try at a different time or from a different network

### Media Optimization Issues

#### Optimization Fails

**Symptom**:
```
Error optimizing image.jpg: Could not process file
```

**Possible Causes**:
1. Missing dependencies
2. Corrupted source file
3. Insufficient system resources

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure required dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pillow ffmpeg-python
   ```
   
2. Verify the source file can be opened with other applications
3. Reduce the number of worker processes:
   ```bash
   s3u -config max_workers 2
   ```

### CloudFront Issues

#### URLs Not Working

**Symptom**: Generated CloudFront URLs return 403 or don't load.

**Possible Causes**:
1. CloudFront distribution not properly configured
2. Origin access settings incorrect
3. CloudFront cache hasn't updated

**Solutions**:
1. Verify your CloudFront distribution settings in AWS Console
2. Ensure the Origin settings point to the correct S3 bucket
3. Wait for CloudFront propagation (can take 15-30 minutes)
4. Check that your CloudFront URL in S3U config is correct:
   ```bash
   s3u -config cloudfront_url https://your-distribution-id.cloudfront.net
   ```

## FAQ

### General Questions

#### What is S3U?

S3U is a command-line utility for uploading files to Amazon S3 and generating CloudFront URLs. It provides a streamlined workflow for managing media assets in AWS, with features for optimization, organization, and retrieval.

#### Is S3U open source?

Yes, S3U is open-source software available under the MIT license. You can view, modify, and distribute the code according to the terms of the license.

#### What operating systems does S3U support?

S3U supports Windows, macOS, and Linux. It requires Python 3.8 or higher.

### AWS-Related Questions

#### Do I need an AWS account to use S3U?

Yes, S3U requires an AWS account with an S3 bucket. For full functionality, a CloudFront distribution connected to your S3 bucket is recommended.

#### What AWS permissions do I need?

At minimum, you need these S3 permissions:
- `s3:PutObject`
- `s3:GetObject`
- `s3:ListBucket`

For all features, include these additional permissions:
- `s3:DeleteObject` (for file management)
- `cloudfront:CreateInvalidation` (for cache invalidation)

#### Can I use S3U with AWS S3-compatible storage?

S3U is designed primarily for AWS S3, but may work with S3-compatible storage providers that implement the same API. However, CloudFront-specific features will only work with AWS.

### Feature Questions

#### Can S3U handle very large files?

Yes, S3U can handle large files, but there are practical limits:
- Files up to 5GB can be uploaded directly
- For optimal performance with large files, reduce concurrency (`-c 3`)
- Video optimization works best for files under 2GB due to memory constraints

#### Does S3U support folder synchronization?

S3U does not currently support full two-way synchronization. It provides these related features:
- Upload files to S3 folders
- Download entire S3 folders
- Browse existing S3 folders

#### Can I schedule automatic uploads?

S3U itself doesn't include scheduling, but you can use system schedulers like cron (Linux/macOS) or Task Scheduler (Windows) to run S3U commands at specified times.

Example cron job to upload files daily at 2 AM:
```
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/files && /usr/local/bin/s3u -q
```

### Troubleshooting Questions

#### How do I update S3U to the latest version?

Update S3U using pip:
```bash
pip install -U s3u
```

#### Will S3U overwrite existing files?

Yes, if you upload a file with the same name to the same S3 path, it will overwrite the existing file. You can use the rename prefix feature to avoid overwrites.

#### How can I reset my S3U configuration?

Reset your configuration with:
```bash
s3u -config reset
```

Or manually delete the configuration file at:
- Linux/macOS: `~/.s3u/config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\s3u\config.json`
