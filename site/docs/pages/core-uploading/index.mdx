# Core Uploading

The upload functionality is the heart of S3U, designed to efficiently transfer files to Amazon S3 and generate CloudFront URLs.

## Interactive Upload Process

S3U provides an intuitive interactive workflow that guides you through the upload process:

```bash
$ s3u

S3 Upload Utility
-----------------

File extensions to include:
  • Enter 'all' or leave blank for all files (default)
  • Enter specific types separated by spaces or commas (e.g., 'jpg png mp4')
  • Or use one of these groups:
    - images: jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp, svg
    - videos: mp4, mov, avi, webm, mkv
    - documents: pdf, doc, docx, txt, md
Extensions [all]: images

Using images group: jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp, svg
Optimize media before uploading? (y/n) [n]: y

Select size (1=optimized [1920px], 2=small [1080px], 3=tiny [640px], 4=pATCHES [1280px, high compression]) [1]: 2

Image format (1=webp [recommended], 2=jpg [compatible], 3=avif [best compression]) [1]: 1

Parallel optimization workers (1-16, higher=faster) [4]: 4

Enter folder name (press Tab to see existing folders)
S3 folder name [current_directory]: vacation_photos

Rename prefix (optional, press Enter to skip): beach_trip

Proceed with upload? (y/n) [y]: y
```

The interactive process follows these steps:

1. **Initialization**: Verify AWS credentials and S3 bucket
2. **File Selection**: Identify files to upload based on extensions
3. **File Preparation**: Optionally rename files and/or optimize media
4. **Folder Preparation**: Create or verify the destination S3 folder
5. **Upload Execution**: Transfer files to S3 with concurrent uploads
6. **URL Generation**: Create CloudFront URLs for uploaded files
7. **Output**: Copy URLs to clipboard in the configured format

:::info
You can bypass the interactive process using the quick mode (`s3u -q`) or by specifying options directly via command-line arguments (`s3u -c 15 -sf preserve`).

## Media Optimization

S3U can automatically optimize your media files before uploading them to S3, resulting in faster uploads and lower storage costs.

### Image Optimization Options

When selecting image optimization, you'll have these options:

1. **Size Options**:

   - **Optimized** (1920px): Best for high-quality website images
   - **Small** (1080px): Ideal for general web usage
   - **Tiny** (640px): Perfect for thumbnails and previews
   - **pATCHES** (1280px): Special high-compression mode

2. **Format Options**:
   - **WebP** (recommended): Modern format with excellent compression
   - **JPG** (compatible): Maximum compatibility across all browsers
   - **AVIF** (best compression): Newest format with smallest file sizes

### Parallel Processing

S3U uses multiple workers to speed up the optimization process:

```
Parallel optimization workers (1-16, higher=faster) [4]: 8

Starting media optimization...
Successfully optimized 15 files in ./optimized/small
```

Higher values process files faster but use more system resources.

## Concurrent Uploads

S3U dramatically improves performance by uploading multiple files simultaneously using asynchronous programming.

### How Concurrency Works

1. A semaphore controls the maximum number of simultaneous uploads
2. Each file upload runs as an independent task
3. The system automatically balances resources and network connections

### Setting Concurrency

You can set the concurrency level in several ways:

1. **Command-line flag** (for a single session):

   ```bash
   s3u -c 15
   ```

2. **Configuration** (persistent setting):

   ```bash
   s3u -config concurrent 10
   ```

3. **Interactive prompt** (if not using other methods)

### Optimal Concurrency Values

The ideal concurrency depends on your network and file sizes:

- **Large files** (videos, high-res images): 3-5 concurrent uploads
- **Medium files** (regular images, documents): 5-10 concurrent uploads
- **Small files** (tiny images, text files): 10-20 concurrent uploads
- **Slow connections**: Lower values (3-5) to avoid timeouts
- **Fast connections**: Higher values (10-15) for maximum throughput

:::tip
Monitor upload speeds during the process. If you see frequent slowdowns or timeouts, reduce the concurrency value.
:::

## Subfolder Handling

S3U provides three ways to handle local subfolders during upload:

### Ignore Mode (Default)

Only uploads files from the current directory:

```bash
s3u -sf ignore
```

- Files in subfolders are skipped
- Simplest approach for flat file structures

### Pool Mode

Combines all files from all subfolders into a single S3 folder:

```bash
s3u -sf pool
```

- Files from all subfolders are "flattened" into the destination folder
- Useful for consolidating content from multiple directories
- Warning: May cause filename conflicts if different subfolders contain files with the same name

### Preserve Mode

Maintains your local folder structure in S3:

```bash
s3u -sf preserve
```

- Creates matching subfolder structure in S3
- Most organized approach for complex file hierarchies
- Ideal for websites and structured content

::::steps

### Example: Ignore Mode (Default)

Consider this local directory structure:

```
project/
├── images/
│   ├── logo.png
│   └── banner.jpg
├── documents/
│   └── spec.pdf
└── README.md
```

With **Ignore mode**, only `README.md` is uploaded

### Example: Pool Mode

With the same directory structure, using **Pool mode**:

All files are uploaded to the same S3 folder (`logo.png`, `banner.jpg`, `spec.pdf`, `README.md`)

### Example: Preserve Mode

With the same directory structure, using **Preserve mode**:

Files are uploaded to matching S3 subfolders:

```
project/
├── images/logo.png
├── images/banner.jpg
├── documents/spec.pdf
└── README.md
```

::::

:::warning
Be careful when using Pool mode with directories containing similarly named files, as this could result in newer uploads overwriting older files.
:::

## Progress Tracking

S3U provides detailed progress information during uploads to keep you informed:

### Per-File Progress

For each file being uploaded, S3U shows:

```
Uploading beach_sunset.jpg: 78.5% | 2.45 MB/s | ETA: 12s
```

This display includes:

1. **Percentage complete**: How much of the file has been uploaded
2. **Upload speed**: Current transfer rate in B/s, KB/s, or MB/s
3. **ETA**: Estimated time remaining for the current file

### Overall Progress

After all uploads complete, you'll see a summary:

```
Completed 15 of 15 uploads
Including existing files in the CDN links...
Total of 23 files in folder (new + existing)
```

:::info
S3U automatically handles error recovery. If an upload fails, it will attempt to continue with the remaining files rather than aborting the entire batch.
:::

## Post-Upload Actions

After uploading files, S3U performs these actions:

### URL Generation

S3U generates CloudFront URLs for all uploaded files:

```
https://d1lbnboj0lfh6w.cloudfront.net/vacation_photos/beach_001.jpg
```

These URLs provide fast, edge-cached access to your content.

### Clipboard Integration

URLs are automatically copied to your clipboard in the format specified by your configuration:

:::code-group

```json [Array Format (Default)]
[
  "https://d1lbnboj0lfh6w.cloudfront.net/folder/file1.jpg",
  "https://d1lbnboj0lfh6w.cloudfront.net/folder/file2.jpg"
]
```

```json [JSON Format]
{
  "folder": "vacation_photos",
  "count": 2,
  "timestamp": "2023-08-15T14:22:33.456789",
  "files": [
    {
      "url": "https://d1lbnboj0lfh6w.cloudfront.net/folder/file1.jpg",
      "filename": "file1.jpg",
      "s3_path": "folder/file1.jpg",
      "size": 245678,
      "last_modified": "2023-08-15T14:20:12.345678",
      "type": "jpg"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

:::

To get only the first URL (useful for single file uploads):

```bash
s3u -f
```

## Advanced Options

S3U provides several advanced options for customizing the upload process:

### Media Optimization

Before uploading, S3U can optimize images and videos:

```bash
s3u -config optimize always
```

### File Renaming

S3U offers flexible file renaming options:

```bash
s3u -config rename_mode prepend
```

### Custom Output Formats

Control how URLs are formatted and copied to the clipboard:

```bash
s3u -config format json
```

:::tip
See the [Configuration](../configuration/) section for more details on these advanced options.

## Troubleshooting

Common upload issues and solutions:

### "Access Denied" Errors

**Cause**: Insufficient IAM permissions

**Solution**: Verify your IAM policy includes:

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": ["s3:PutObject", "s3:ListBucket"],
  "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
    "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
  ]
}
```

### Slow Uploads

**Cause**: Network limitations or excessive concurrency

**Solution**:

- Reduce concurrency with `s3u -c 5`
- Check your network connection
- Consider optimizing large media files before upload

### Failed Uploads with Timeout

**Cause**: Network interruptions or very large files

**Solution**:

- Reduce concurrency
- Try uploading files individually
- Check for firewall or proxy issues

### "No Files to Upload" Message

**Cause**: No matching files or incorrect extension filter

**Solution**:

- Check the file extensions you specified
- Verify files exist in the current directory
- Try using `all` for extensions to include all files

### CloudFront URLs Not Working

**Cause**: CloudFront distribution not properly configured or deployed

**Solution**:

- Verify your CloudFront distribution is enabled
- Check the Origin settings in CloudFront
- Wait for CloudFront propagation (can take 15-30 minutes)
