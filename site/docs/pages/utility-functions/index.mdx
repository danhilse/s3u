# Utility Functions

Beyond its core uploading capabilities, S3U provides several utility functions for file management, folder operations, and content retrieval. This guide covers the non-uploading functionality in the S3U tool.

## Listing Folders

S3U provides functionality to list and manage folders in your S3 bucket.

### Viewing All Folders

Use the `-ls` flag to see all folders in your bucket with item counts:

```bash
s3u -ls
```

Example output:
```
Folders in S3 bucket:
--------------------------------------------------
Folder Name                              Items     
--------------------------------------------------
landscapes                               42        
portraits                                18        
watercolors                              37        
--------------------------------------------------
Total: 3 folders
```

This helps you:
- Get an overview of your bucket's organization
- See which folders contain the most items
- Find folders you might have forgotten about

### Folder Existence Checking

Before uploading, S3U automatically checks if the destination folder already exists. If it exists, you'll be prompted:

```
Folder 'vacation_photos' already exists in S3 bucket.
Include existing files in CDN links? (y/n) [y]: 
```

- Answering `y` includes both new and existing files in the output URLs
- Answering `n` includes only newly uploaded files

:::tip
This helps prevent accidentally creating duplicate folders with slight name variations.
:::

## Browsing Content

S3U includes functions to browse existing content and generate CloudFront URLs without uploading new files.

### Browsing Folders

To get CloudFront URLs for files in an existing folder:

```bash
s3u -b folder_name
```

This lists all objects in the folder and copies their URLs to your clipboard in the configured format.

### Limiting Results

You can limit the number of URLs returned:

```bash
s3u -b folder_name 12
```

This returns only the first 12 items (sorted alphabetically).

### Recursive Browsing

When using the preserve subfolder mode, browsing will recursively list all files including those in subfolders:

```bash
s3u -b folder_name -sf preserve
```

### URL Formats

The URLs are formatted according to your `format` configuration:

:::code-group
```json [Array Format (Default)]
["https://d1lbnboj0lfh6w.cloudfront.net/folder/file1.jpg", "https://d1lbnboj0lfh6w.cloudfront.net/folder/file2.jpg"]
```

```json [JSON Format]
{
  "folder": "vacation_photos",
  "count": 2,
  "timestamp": "2023-08-15T14:22:33.456789",
  "files": [
    {
      "url": "https://d1lbnboj0lfh6w.cloudfront.net/folder/file1.jpg",
      "filename": "file1.jpg",
      "s3_path": "folder/file1.jpg",
      "size": 245678,
      "last_modified": "2023-08-15T14:20:12.345678",
      "type": "jpg"
    },
    {
      "url": "https://d1lbnboj0lfh6w.cloudfront.net/folder/file2.jpg",
      "filename": "file2.jpg",
      "s3_path": "folder/file2.jpg",
      "size": 312456,
      "last_modified": "2023-08-15T14:21:45.678901",
      "type": "jpg"
    }
  ]
}
```

```html [HTML Format]
<html>
<head><title>S3U Generated Links</title></head>
<body>
<h1>Files in folder: vacation_photos</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://d1lbnboj0lfh6w.cloudfront.net/folder/file1.jpg">file1.jpg</a></li>
<li><a href="https://d1lbnboj0lfh6w.cloudfront.net/folder/file2.jpg">file2.jpg</a></li>
</ul>
</body>
</html>
```

:::info
To get only the first URL (useful for single file browsing):

```bash
s3u -b folder_name -f
```
:::

## Downloading Files

S3U allows you to download entire folders from your S3 bucket.

### Basic Downloads

To download a folder:

```bash
s3u -d folder_name
```

This creates a local directory with the same name and downloads all files from the S3 folder.

### Advanced Download Options

You can customize downloads with additional options:

::::steps
### Limit the Number of Files
Download only the first 5 files from a folder:
```bash
s3u -d folder_name 5
```

### Specify Output Directory
Download to a specific directory:
```bash
s3u -d folder_name -o ./downloaded_files
```

### Include Subfolders
Download files recursively including subfolders:
```bash
s3u -d folder_name -sf preserve
```
::::

### Download Features

The download functionality includes:

1. **Concurrent downloads**: Multiple files are downloaded simultaneously for speed
2. **Progress tracking**: Real-time progress is displayed with ETA
3. **Directory creation**: Destination directories are created if they don't exist
4. **Structure preservation**: Subfolder structures can be maintained
5. **Error handling**: Failed downloads are reported but don't stop the process

Example download session:
```
Downloading folder 'vacation_photos'...
Creating local directory ./vacation_photos

Downloading beach_001.jpg: 100.0% | 4.21 MB/s | ETA: 0s
Downloading sunset_002.jpg: 100.0% | 3.87 MB/s | ETA: 0s
[...]

Downloaded 15 of 15 files successfully
```

:::tip
For large folders, downloads use the same concurrent processing system as uploads. You can adjust concurrency with:
```bash
s3u -config concurrent 10
```
:::

## File Renaming

S3U can rename files before uploading using customizable patterns. This is useful for organizing files and creating consistent naming schemes.

### Renaming Modes

There are three renaming modes available:

| Mode | Description | Example with prefix "vacation" |
|------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| `replace` (default) | Replace original filenames with pattern `prefix_index` | beach.jpg → vacation_001.jpg |
| `prepend` | Add prefix before original filename with pattern `prefix_originalname` | beach.jpg → vacation_beach.jpg |
| `append` | Add prefix after original filename with pattern `originalname_prefix` | beach.jpg → beach_vacation.jpg |

### Setting Your Rename Mode

You can set your preferred rename mode in the configuration:

```bash
s3u -config rename_mode prepend
```

### Automatic Sequential Numbering

When using `replace` mode, files are automatically numbered with leading zeros based on the total number of files:

- 1-9 files: Single digit (e.g., `vacation_1.jpg`)
- 10-99 files: Two digits (e.g., `vacation_01.jpg`)
- 100-999 files: Three digits (e.g., `vacation_001.jpg`)
- 1000+ files: Four digits (e.g., `vacation_0001.jpg`)

This ensures proper alphabetical sorting in file listings.

### Using with Upload Process

During the interactive upload process, you'll be prompted for a rename prefix:

```
Enter folder name (press Tab to see existing folders)
S3 folder name [current_directory]: vacation_photos

Rename prefix (optional, press Enter to skip): beach_trip
```

- Entering a prefix will rename files according to your configured rename mode
- Pressing Enter without a prefix will keep original filenames

:::warning
When using rename mode with the `pool` subfolder handling option, be aware that files with the same name from different subfolders may conflict.
:::

## File Selection and Filtering

S3U lets you filter which files to include in operations based on their extensions.

### How File Selection Works

Files are filtered using these rules:

1. If no extensions are specified, all files are included except:
   - Hidden files (starting with `.`)
   - System files like `.DS_Store`

2. When extensions are specified, only files matching those extensions are processed
   - Example: `jpg png gif` will only include image files with those extensions

### Extension Examples

```bash
# Process only image files
s3u
Extensions: jpg png gif

# Process only video files
s3u
Extensions: mp4 mov

# Process documents
s3u
Extensions: pdf doc docx txt

# Process all files (default)
s3u
Extensions: all
```

### Extension Groups

S3U supports predefined extension groups for convenience:

| Group | Extensions |
|-------|------------|
| `images` | jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp, svg |
| `videos` | mp4, mov, avi, webm, mkv |
| `documents` | pdf, doc, docx, txt, md |

Example:
```bash
s3u
Extensions: images
```

This will select all image files for processing.

## Advanced Features

### MIME Type Handling

S3U automatically determines the correct MIME type for files to ensure proper handling:

| Extension | MIME Type |
|-----------|-----------|
| .jpg, .jpeg | image/jpeg |
| .png | image/png |
| .gif | image/gif |
| .webp | image/webp |
| .avif | image/avif |
| .mp4 | video/mp4 |
| .mov | video/quicktime |
| .webm | video/webm |
| .pdf | application/pdf |

:::info
Correct MIME types ensure:
- Browsers handle files appropriately (e.g., playing videos instead of downloading them)
- CloudFront serves files with the correct `Content-Type` header
- Files can be properly indexed and categorized
:::

### Command Line Reference

Here's a quick reference for utility function command-line flags:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-ls` | List all folders in the bucket with item counts |
| `-b FOLDER` | Browse an existing folder and get URLs |
| `-d FOLDER` | Download files from a folder |
| `-o DIR` | Specify output directory for downloads |
| `-sf MODE` | Set subfolder handling mode (ignore, pool, preserve) |
| `-f` | Copy only the first URL to clipboard |

## Use Cases and Examples

Here are some practical examples of using S3U's utility functions:

::::steps
### Content Inventory
Take inventory of your S3 bucket to see what's stored where:

```bash
# List all folders
s3u -ls

# Browse specific folders to check contents
s3u -b interesting_folder
```

### Content Migration
Move files from one location to another:

```bash
# Download content from source folder
s3u -d source_folder -o ./migration

# Upload to new destination
cd ./migration
s3u
# Enter destination_folder when prompted
```

### Folder Organization
Consolidate files from multiple subfolders:

```bash
# Create a directory structure
mkdir -p project/{images,videos,documents}

# Add files to each subfolder
# ...

# Upload preserving structure
s3u -sf preserve
# Enter "project" as the S3 folder name

# Or pool all files together
s3u -sf pool
# Enter "project_all" as the S3 folder name
```

### Quick Access to Content
