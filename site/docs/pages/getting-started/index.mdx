# Getting Started

S3U is a powerful command-line utility for uploading files to Amazon S3 and generating CloudFront URLs. This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

## Installation

S3U can be installed using pip, the Python package manager:

```bash
pip install s3u
```

For the latest development version, you can install directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/yourusername/s3u.git
```

:::info
S3U requires Python 3.8 or higher.
:::

### Prerequisites

Before using S3U, ensure you have:

1. **Python 3.8+** installed on your system
2. **FFmpeg and FFprobe** installed (required for image optimization)
3. **AWS credentials** configured
4. An **S3 bucket** with appropriate permissions
5. A **CloudFront distribution** connected to your S3 bucket (recommended)

#### Installing FFmpeg

FFmpeg is required for image and video optimization features:

::::steps
### On macOS:
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

### On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

### On Windows:
1. Download FFmpeg from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
2. Extract the files to a folder (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg`)
3. Add the bin folder to your PATH: `C:\ffmpeg\bin`
::::

### Verifying Installation

To verify that S3U is installed correctly, run:

```bash
s3u --version
```

You should see output showing the version number:

```
S3 Upload Utility v1.2.3
```

## AWS Configuration

S3U requires proper AWS configuration to access your S3 buckets and CloudFront distribution.

### Setting Up AWS Credentials

S3U uses the standard AWS credential system. You can configure your credentials in several ways:

::::steps
### AWS CLI Configuration
The simplest method is to use the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws configure
```

This will prompt you for:
- AWS Access Key ID
- AWS Secret Access Key
- Default region
- Default output format

### Manual Configuration
Create or edit the credentials file located at:
- Linux/macOS: `~/.aws/credentials`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials`

```ini
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
region = us-east-1
```

### Environment Variables
Set the following environment variables:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

On Windows:
```cmd
set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
set AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```
::::

:::danger
Never hardcode your AWS credentials in your scripts or commit them to version control!
:::

### Required Permissions

Your AWS user or role needs specific permissions to use S3U effectively:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:GetBucketLocation"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "cloudfront:ListDistributions"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Replace `your-bucket-name` with your actual S3 bucket name.

### Bucket Configuration

Your S3 bucket needs to be properly configured, especially if you plan to use CloudFront for content delivery.

::::steps
### 1. Create an S3 Bucket
If you don't already have an S3 bucket, create one:

1. Open the [Amazon S3 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)
2. Click "Create bucket"
3. Enter a globally unique bucket name
4. Select your preferred region
5. Configure bucket settings (public access settings, versioning, etc.)
6. Click "Create bucket"

### 2. Configure CORS (Optional)
If you'll be accessing the uploaded files from web applications, you may need to configure CORS:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET"],
    "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": [],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
  }
]
```

:::warning
The CORS policy above allows access from any origin. For production, restrict the AllowedOrigins to your specific domains.
:::

### 3. Set up CloudFront Distribution
For faster content delivery and better URL structure:

1. Open the [CloudFront Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)
2. Click "Create Distribution"
3. Under "Origin Domain", select your S3 bucket
4. Under "Origin Access", select "Origin Access Control settings (recommended)"
5. Create a new OAC and allow CloudFront to create the bucket policy
6. Configure other settings as needed (cache behavior, restrictions, etc.)
7. Click "Create Distribution"

### 4. Update Bucket Policy
After creating the CloudFront distribution, ensure your bucket policy allows CloudFront access:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowCloudFrontServicePrincipal",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::your-account-id:distribution/your-distribution-id"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Replace:
- `your-bucket-name` with your S3 bucket name
- `your-account-id` with your AWS account ID
- `your-distribution-id` with your CloudFront distribution ID
::::

### Custom AWS Profiles

If you manage multiple AWS environments or accounts, you can use AWS profiles to switch between them in S3U:

```bash
s3u -config aws_profile production
```

To revert to using the default profile:
```bash
s3u -config aws_profile ""
```

## Setup

After installing S3U and configuring AWS credentials, you need to configure S3U to use your S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution.

### Initial Configuration

Run the following command to set up your S3U configuration:

```bash
s3u --setup
```

This will guide you through the following steps:

1. Setting your S3 bucket name
2. Configuring your CloudFront distribution (if any)
3. Setting default upload preferences
4. Configuring output formats

### Manual Configuration

You can also manually edit the configuration file located at:

- Linux/macOS: `~/.config/s3u/config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\s3u\config.json`

Here's an example configuration file:

```json
{
  "bucket": "my-files-bucket",
  "cloudfront_domain": "d1lbnboj0lfh6w.cloudfront.net",
  "default_folder": "uploads",
  "concurrent_uploads": 5,
  "output_format": "array",
  "optimize_media": "ask",
  "rename_mode": "preserve",
  "subfolder_handling": "ignore"
}
```

### Verifying Configuration

To verify your configuration, run:

```bash
s3u --status
```

This will display your current configuration settings:

```
S3 Upload Utility - Configuration Status
----------------------------------------
Bucket: my-files-bucket
CloudFront: d1lbnboj0lfh6w.cloudfront.net
AWS Profile: default
Default Folder: uploads
Concurrency: 5
Output Format: array
Media Optimization: ask
Rename Mode: preserve
Subfolder Handling: ignore
```

:::info
CloudFront may take up to 30 minutes to fully deploy a new distribution. During this time, you might not be able to access your content through CloudFront URLs.
:::

## Your First Upload

Now that you've installed and configured S3U, let's try a simple upload:

```bash
# Navigate to a directory with files to upload
cd ~/Pictures/vacation

# Start the interactive upload process
s3u
```

Follow the prompts to upload your files. Upon completion, URLs for your uploaded files will be copied to your clipboard.

:::tip
For a quick upload without any prompts, use the quick mode:
```bash
s3u -q
```
:::
